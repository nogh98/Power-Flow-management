# Power-Flow-management
The code for optimizing the cost of an Electric Vehicle charging-station
The input to the algorithm:

      -- one day of Photovoltaic cell production (in a hour basis)
      
      -- The load of the charging station (in a hour basis)
      
      -- The tariff (the cost of purchasing 1 KW power from the main grid) 
      
      -- The amount of charge available in the charging station's battery 
      
The outputs of the algorithm:

      -- The amount of power to take from or inject to the battery
      
      -- The amount of power to purchase from the sell grid
      
      
To run the algorithm: run the file PFM.py
